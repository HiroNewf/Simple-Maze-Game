# Simple-Maze-Game (Not Finished)
This is a work in progress, but my goal is to make this a maze game. There will be different levels and each time you finish one maze you will be teleported to the next level of the game. Once you finish all levels the game will tell you your time (how long it took you to finish the mazes) and restart you from the beginning. 

# What is currently completed
1. Base canvas
2. Player and player movements
3. Collision detection 
4. Boarder walls 
5. The first maze
6. A start and end 

# What I am going to add next
1. Add the teleporting system that will detect when you reached the end of the level and move you to the next level
2. Add the timer which will keep track of your current time (Will be displayed on the screen somewhere) and it will also tell you your time when you beat the game.
3. Finally I will create more levels (Probably around 5 for now) and that will probably be about it. I might change around the asthenic of game to make it prettier or something, but I don't plan to add much more than listed here.
