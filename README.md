# Simple-Maze-Game (Not Finished)
Probably just going to ditch this and work on something else. It could be finished, but I am getting rather bored with it and it is rather repeditive making the mazes and adding the boarder detection. 

# What is completed
1. Base canvas
2. Player and player movements
3. Collision detection 
4. Boarder walls 
5. The first maze
6. A start and end 

# What I was going to add next
1. Add the teleporting system that will detect when you reached the end of the level and move you to the next level
2. Add the timer which will keep track of your current time (Will be displayed on the screen somewhere) and it will also tell you your time when you beat the game.
3. Create more levels (Probably around 5)
